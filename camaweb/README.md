#College Admissions Mentors For Africa

This is a [website](http://dirichi.github.io/CAMAProject/camaweb/) hosted on github using gh-pages. Most of the layout borrows from the Bootstrap [Agency](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) theme,  a one page agency portfolio theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
